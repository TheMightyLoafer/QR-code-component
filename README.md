## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was a great review of using flexbox to create and render content in the center of a page. Great for small components.



### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/) - This really helped me understand how to use flexbox and the different syntax.
- [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) - This is an amazing program. I have learned the majority of what I now know thanks to Scrimba.
